No code today, I worked out day 24 using a text editor + pen & paper.

The `MONAD` program basically boils down to manipulating a stack (hidden inside the `z` register)
and the equal counts of `div z 1`s and `div z 26`s as well as nice constants elsewhere made it 
so that there was no branching, allowing me to easily pair up input digits.
